# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation
### Step 2:
Get the input for list 1 and 2
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](https://github.com/ragulmani936/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/blob/main/formula.JPG?raw=true)
### Step 4:
Print the distance
### Step 5:
End the program
### PROGRAM:
~~~
#Program to find the distance between two points.

import numpy as np
l2 = [4,2]
l1 = [10,6]
distance = np.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
